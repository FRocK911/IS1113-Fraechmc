        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        <p>Many of us know that Blockchain is a topic that is hot at the moment. It's a topic that is disruptive. It's a topic that is accelerating.

And that may be your elevator pitch...

But now imagine your elevator stops between floors and you are asked "Great overview - but can you explain to me how it really works?".

Here is my attempt to explain the original intent of the Blockchain in fewer than 100 words.

You (a "node") have a file of transactions on your computer (a "ledger"). Two government accountants (let's call them "miners") have the same file on theirs (so it’s "distributed"). As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.

Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary "Bitcoins"). The first to check and validate hits “REPLY ALL”, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction ("Proof of Work"). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file…

This concept is enabled by "Blockchain" technology.<p/>
        
        <h1>Autonomous things</h1>
        <p>The term “autonomous things” is being used more and more in the technology world to talk about phenomena powered by the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Autonomous things are things that work autonomously without human guidance or direct intervention.</p>
   
        <h1>Immersive Experience</h1>
        <p>The three pillars of immersive experiences are visual quality, sound quality, and intuitive interactions. Full immersion can only be achieved by simultaneously focusing on these pillars.</p>
